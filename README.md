# Inspirational Quote Generator

The Inspirational Quote Generator is a web application built using React, TypeScript (TSX), CSS, SCSS, and Framer Motion, and it's bootstrapped with Vite. The application fetches and displays random quotes from the Quotable API and then gives you a Wikipedia link to visit the quote's author.
